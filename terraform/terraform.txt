Hey there! Don't forget to create a 'terraform.tfvars' file that contains your account details! This file is inside
.gitignore, so you won't expose your secret keys to the world!


terraform/terraform.tfvars example: 

aws-secret-key = "ul4hBTyt86W3333ts+kwhPZN434E8OdqaUdAPjy"
aws-access-key = "AKIAVIIJBESVJHHJH5EWV"
aws-region     = "us-west-2"
