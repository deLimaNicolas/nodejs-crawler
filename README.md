# nodejs-crawler
Crawler using terraform and Logstash for logs

# Project
##### A simple crawler that will retrieve data from Mercado Livre(e-commerce).

# Infra as a code!
![terraform](https://miro.medium.com/max/472/1*rmwpOy4OtvgVz3yJvBetuQ.png)
##### We are going to use terraform to set our infrastructure! There will be a folder called infra in our project and it will be responsible for deploying our virtual machine and our Kafka.

# Crawler
##### For this one, we will be using cheerio + request(node), to have a stack with a lot of content on the community and also that will not increase so much the size of our packages.

# Logging

##### The famous ELK stack.

# CI/CD

##### circle-ci
