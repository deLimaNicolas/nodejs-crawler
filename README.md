# nodejs-crawler
Crawler using terraform and Logstash for logs

# Project
#####  We are going to write a simple crawler that will retrieve data from Mercado Livre(e-commerce) but of course, we`re going to me things more interesting so this repository can give some real use for the community. So check it out some of the features we are going to implement!

# Infra as a code!

##### We are going to use terraform to set our infrastructure! There will be a folder called infra in our project and it will be responsible for deploying our virtual machine and our Kafka.

# Typescript

##### We are going to make tests, but also use typescript, this way our code will have a strong foundation of types checking! You can see it as double testing.

# Jest with Supertest

##### Strong foundations is tests, and I mean real request tests!

# Crawler
##### For this one, we will be using cheerio + request(node), to have a stack with a lot of content on the community and also that will not increase so much the size of our packages.

# Logging

##### The famous ELK stack.

# CI/CD

##### circle-ci
